            <h1> What is a Malware Attack?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>A malware attack is a common cyberattack where malware (normally malicious software) executes unauthorized actions on the victim’s system. The malicious software (a.k.a. virus) encompasses many specific types of attacks such as ransomware, spyware, command and control, and more.</p>

            <h1>Types of Malware Attack </h1>
        </div>
        <p>There are several major types of malware to keep an eye out for:<br>

Adware — Adware automatically delivers advertisements to generate revenue for its creator or a third party. It is often used in conjunction with spyware.<br>
Backdoor (trapdoor) — A backdoor allows cybercriminals to access a computer without the user’s knowledge. Backdoors are meant for future use and can remain in a system for years without being noticed.<br>
Rogueware — Rogueware misleads users into believing their device is infected so they will click on a fake warning, which promptly installs malware.<br>
Ransomware — Ransomware restricts users from accessing a system or its data, and often threatens to publish or delete data, until ransom is paid. Locker ransomware restricts access to the infected device, while crypto ransomware restricts access to stored data and files.<br>
Spyware — Spyware is designed to gather information about a user or business. Once installed, it can log keystrokes and extract sensitive information. Spyware can also enable hackers to watch and listen through cameras and microphones.<br>
Trojan horse — A Trojan horse imitates legitimate software to deceive users into installing other malware.<br>
Virus — The oldest type of malware, viruses alters the way a computer operates. A virus can replicate itself and spread to other devices, but it must be attached to another program or executed by a user action.<br>
Worm — Worms are the most common type of malware and one of the most dangerous, because they can replicate themselves without being attached to a program or run by a user. <br>
