            <h1> What is Man in the middle Attack ?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>A man in the middle (MITM) attack is a general term for when a perpetrator positions himself in a conversation between a user and an application—either to eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway.</p>

            <h1>Types of Man in the middle attack </h1>
        </div>
        <p>Cybercriminals can use MITM attacks to gain control of devices in a variety of ways.<br>
             IP spoofing-Every device capable of connecting to the internet has an internet protocol (IP) address, which is similar to the street address for your home. <br>
            DNS spoofing- Domain Name Server, or DNS, spoofing is a technique that forces a user to a fake website rather than the real one the user intends to visit. 
<br>
 HTTPS spoofing-When doing business on the internet, seeing “HTTPS” in the URL, rather than “HTTP” is a sign that the website is secure and can be trusted. In fact, the “S” stands for “secure.” <br>
SSL hijacking-When your device connects to an unsecure server — indicated by “HTTP” — the server can often automatically redirect you to the secure version of the server, indicated by “HTTPS".<br>
Email hijacking-Cybercriminals sometimes target email accounts of banks and other financial institutions. Once they gain access, they can monitor transactions between the institution and its customers.<br>
Wi-Fi eavesdropping-Cybercriminals can set up Wi-Fi connections with very legitimate sounding names, similar to a nearby business. Once a user connects to the fraudster’s Wi-Fi, the attacker will be able to monitor the user’s online activity and be able to intercept login credentials, payment card information, and more. <br>
Stealing browser cookies-To understand the risk of stolen browser cookies, you need to understand what one is. A browser cookie is a small piece of information a website stores on your computer.        </p>

            <h1>How do I protect my network against Man in the middle attack?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Blocking MITM attacks requires several practical steps on the part of users, as well as a combination of encryption and verification methods for applications.
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Avoiding WiFi connections that aren’t password protected.</LI>
<LI>Paying attention to browser notifications reporting a website as being unsecured.</LI>
<LI>Immediately logging out of a secure application when it’s not in use.</LI>
<LI>Not using public networks (e.g., coffee shops, hotels) when conducting sensitive transactions.</LI>
