            <h1> What is Password Attack ?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>A password attack is simply when a hacker trys to steal your password. ... Because passwords can only contain so many letters and numbers, passwords are becoming less safe. Hackers know that many passwords are poorly designed, so password attacks will remain a method of attack as long as passwords are being used.</p>

        <div style="background-color: rgb(212, 241, 229);" class="header">
            <h1>Types of Password attack </h1>
        </div>
        <p>Brute Force Attack-One of the most common forms of password attack methods, and the easiest for hackers to perform. In fact, inexperienced hackers favor this method precisely because of this.  <br>
Dictionary Attack-Conversely, a dictionary attack allows hackers to employ a program that cycles through common words. A brute force attack goes letter by letter, whereas a dictionary attack only tries possibilities most likely to succeed.  <br>
Rainbow Table Attack-Wisely, enterprises often hash their users’ passwords; hashing entails mathematically converting caches of passwords into cryptographic, random-looking strings of characters to prevent them from being misused. If hackers can’t read the passwords, they can’t abuse them.<br>
Credential Stuffing-Almost all of the password attack methods covered here assume the hackers don’t already possess your users’ passwords. However, this may not prove true. One of the underreported but most devastating effects of data breaches is its cascading effect on other enterprises. Put simply, data breaches lead to more data breaches long-term.<br>
Password Spraying-Here is another member of the brute force password attack methods family. Password spraying tries thousands if not millions of accounts at once with a few commonly used passwords. If even one user has a weak password, your whole business may end up at risk.  <br>
Keylogger Attack-Finally, keylogger attacks install a program on users’ endpoints to track all of a users’ keystrokes. So as the user types in their usernames and passwords, the hackers record them for use later. This technically falls under the category of malware or a digital virus, so it must first infect the users’ endpoints (often through a phishing download).</p>

            <h1>How do I protect my network against Password attack?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Preventing passwords from being cracked by malicious actors is a key line of defense. Here are two ways organizations and users can reduce the risks of password cracking.
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Password policies-Password policies are a front line of defense. They are typically a set of rules intended to improve security by motivating or compelling users to create and maintain dependable, safe passwords. Password policies govern password lifecycle events, such as authentication, periodic resets, and expiration. </LI>
<LI> Password screening-One of the best ways to prevent dictionary attacks is to screen them against known lists of dictionary passwords and compromised passwords. Compromised password screens collect compromised data from the internet and Dark Web sources and then determines if the password a user is trying to create has been compromised. </LI>
